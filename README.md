# notable_ca_companies
While I'm learning Power BI on Microsoft Learn, this is a little toy I made showing the most notable Canadian firms based on the data from Wikipedia:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_Canada  
The time span is from 1670 (when Hudson's Bay was estb.) to 2018, where the compnies in active or defunct are included  
The criteria of "Notable" is unknown to me, but it's defined by the editor of this Wikipedia page
